## Technologies
- **HTML** - structure and organization of content for the CloudBooks Pro web application including elements like: <br> 
                - Login page (for users to enter their credentials) <br>
                - Dashboard (to display QuickBooks features and user options) <br>
                - Navigation bar, buttons, input fields, and text sections for account and financial data <br>
- **CSS** - style and visually enhance the user interface, ensuring a professional, polished look<br>
                - will be used for a responsive design, ensuring the app looks good on different devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)<br>
                - styling for the login page, user dashboard, and financial data visualization<br>
                - animations for loading states or user interactions, such as button clicks or transitions between pages<br>
- **JavaScript** - add interactivity to the application and handle user interactions<br>
                    - handle dynamic actions, such as logging in, validating input fields, fetching and displaying data (e.g., transactions, account details)<br>
                    - Integrate third-party APIs for additional functionality (e.g., using a currency exchange rate API to show up-to-date rates)<br>
- **React** - build a dynamic, component-based front-end using React<br>
                - build a single-page application (SPA), with reusable components for login, dashboard, and user account sections<br>
                - implement routing to switch between views, like the login page, dashboard, and settings<br>
                - state management will ensure that as a user performs actions (e.g., viewing their transactions), the page updates instantly without needing a refresh<br>
- **Web Service** - handle communication between the frontend and backend services<br>
                    - create a backend API to manage user authentication, data retrieval (e.g., QuickBooks financial data), and account settings<br>
                    - Call third-party APIs to extend functionality, such as:<br>
                        - Using a public API like https://vatcomply.com/documentation to calculate VAT rates for different countries.<br>
                        - Fetching live stock price data via https://www.alphavantage.co to assist with financial forecasting for users<br>
- **DB/Login** - allow users to securely log in and manage their accounts, store and render persistent data, such as user information and QuickBooks data<br>
                    - implement user registration and login features, storing user credentials in a secure database (Mongo DB)<br>
                    - once logged in, users should see a personalized dashboard with their name and profile and allowing them to view their transaction history, invoices, and reports <br>
- **WebSocket** - enable real-time data updates and synchronization<br>
                    - real-time collaboration, like when multiple users are viewing the same account (e.g., a business owner and an accountant)<br>
                    - receive real-time updates on changes to financial data (e.g., when a transaction is updated, all users receive the update without refreshing)<br>
                    - display real-time notifications when new transactions, invoices, or payments are processed<br>
                    - live chat with IT support<br>
## HTML Deliverable

### Overview
In this deliverable, we have structured the initial HTML framework for CloudBooks Pro. This includes creating multiple HTML pages with placeholders for future content and functionality. The main components of the application are represented in separate HTML files, ensuring a clear and organized structure.

### Implemented Pages
1. **index.html**: The main landing page of the application. It includes:
   - A header with the application title.
   - A navigation bar with links to other pages.
   - A main content area with a brief description of the application.
   - A footer with a link to the GitHub repository.

2. **login.html**: The login page for user authentication. It includes:
   - A header with the page title.
   - A navigation bar with links to other pages.
   - A form for users to enter their username and password.
   - A footer with a link to the GitHub repository.

3. **data.html**: A placeholder page for displaying database data. It includes:
   - A header with the page title.
   - A navigation bar with links to other pages.
   - A main content area with a placeholder for database data.
   - A footer with a link to the GitHub repository.

4. **realtime.html**: A placeholder page for displaying real-time data via WebSockets. It includes:
   - A header with the page title.
   - A navigation bar with links to other pages.
   - A main content area with a placeholder for real-time data.
   - A footer with a link to the GitHub repository.

### CSS Enhancements
The CSS file has been improved to enhance the visual appeal and responsiveness of the application. Key improvements include:
- A responsive design using media queries to ensure the layout looks good on different screen sizes.
- Improved navigation with styles for active links and hover effects.
- Enhanced footer styling to ensure it stays at the bottom of the page.
- Padding and margin adjustments for better readability.
- Specific styling for the GitHub link in the footer.

### GitHub Repository
The footer of each HTML page includes a link to the GitHub repository for this project, ensuring easy access for further development and collaboration.

### Next Steps
- Implement the backend services for user authentication, data retrieval, and real-time updates.
- Integrate the frontend with the backend services using JavaScript and React.
- Enhance the visual design with more detailed CSS and possibly additional libraries or frameworks.
- Continuously commit and push changes to GitHub to track progress and maintain version control.
