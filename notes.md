# Notes for CS 260
## How to use Markdown
- for different headings use:
```
# first level (biggest)
## second level
### third level (smallest)
```

- for typing out code blocks use backticks (``)
- styling text:
    - **bold** - (`**word**` or `__word__`) - use asterisks or double underscore
    - *italic* - (`*word*` or `_word_`) - use one asterisk or one underscore
    - ~~Strikethrough~~ - (`~~word~~`) - use double tilde
    - **bold and _nested_ italic** - (`**bolded words and _italicized_ words**`) - double asterisk and one underscore
    - ***all bold and italic*** - (`***words***`) - three asterisks
    - Sub<sub>script</sub> - (`word and <sub>subscripted</sub> word`) - use html `<sub>` code
    - Super<sup>script</sup> - (`word and <sup>scripted</sup> word`) - use html `<sup>` code


## AWS
- ssh command to access my server
```
ssh -i /path/to/.pem/file ubuntu@98.82.89.111
```
- server ip address: **98.82.89.111**


## What I learned from this first assignment
- I learned about how to write effective markdown notes and am excited to learn more about it. I have used github for awhile now but I haven't ever really used the README or any type of markdown file before
- also it was fun to learn more about merging conflicts
